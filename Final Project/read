Our synth works subtractively by generating white noise and bandpassing it based on what MIDI notes are input. 
We created this in a Jupyter Notebook, but had a little trouble when exporting to a .py file to get the CLI working. 
Our .py file has a working CLI, but for some reason the synth funciton keeps giving us an error when we call it.
Please check out the .ipynb file if it is not too much trouble: the synth functions fully inside the notebook. Refer to the test cell at the end.
